#TODO:
##High Priority
- <del>Report kills</del>
- Have a preconnection screen
    - lets you set a prefered nick name, or log in
- Handle the invite command (by parsing channel links)

##Medium
- Parse the input field for irc commands
- Storing previous sent items (so you can up arrow to them)

##Low Priority
- Tab autocompletion for nicks and channels
- Deal with the ctcp messages
